## Duckett JS book

### introduction
#### Javascript allows you to make web pages more interactive by accessing and modifying the content and markup used in a web page while it's being viewed in browser.

### chapter 1 : The ABC  of programming 
#### A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow step by step to achieve a goal. similar to handbooks and manuals. Computers approach tasks in a different way than humans, so your instructions must let the computer solve the task prggrammatically. To approach writing a script, break down your goal into series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task (a flowchart can help).
#### The document object is just one of a set of objects that all major browsers support. When the browser creates a model of a web page, it not only creates a document object, but it also creates a new object for each element on the page. Together these objects are described in the Document Object Model. When you want to use JavaScript with a web page, you use the HTML <script> element to tell the browser it is coming across a script. Its s re attribute tells people where the JavaScript file is stored. You may see JavaScript in the HTML between opening <script> and closing </script> tags.

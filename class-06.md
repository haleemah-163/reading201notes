### Understanding The priblem domain

##### The idea behind the Protein Tracker application is that it allows a user to set a goal for the amount of protein to consume in a day.
##### By creating a familiar problem domain, both the tasks of teaching a new technology and the viewer learning that technology were much easier, because it is very difficult to learn more than one thing at once.
#### Why problem domains are hard
##### Writing code is a lot like putting together a jigsaw puzzle.  We put together code with the purpose of building components that we have taken out of the “bigger picture” of the problem domain.
##### The big issue is that many problem domains are like a puzzle with a blurry picture or no picture at all.
#### So Programming is easy if you understand the problem domain

#### Chapter 3: Object Literals
##### Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object, variables and functions take on new names. and the easiest way to create an object is literal notation and you can access the properties of it by dot notation or square breckets

#### Chapter 5: Document Object Mode
##### The Document Object Model (DOM) specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML page and how JavaScript can access and update the contents of a web page while it is in the browser window.DOM queries may return one element, or they may return a Nodelist, which is a collection of nodes.
##### Traversing the DOM can be difficult because some browsers add a text node whenever they come across whitespace between elements. 
##### Modern browsers come with tools that help you inspect the page loaded in the browser and understand the structure of the DOM tree.
##### DOM trees have four types of nodes: document nodes, element nodes, attribute nodes, and text nodes.

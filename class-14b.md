#### So as a continue from the previous part; In other words, if you are given
####  a choice between the serious-minded Team or the free-flowing Team ,
#### you should probably opt for second Team . 
#### The first team may be filled with smart people, all optimized for peak individual efficiency. 
#### But the group’s norms discourage equal speaking; there are few exchanges of the kind of personal
####  information that lets teammates pick up on what people are feeling or leaving unsaid.
#### There’s a good chance the members of the first team will continue to act like individuals once
#### they come together, and there’s little to suggest that, as a group, they will
#### become more collectively intelligent.
#### In contrast, on the second team, people may speak over one another,
#### go on tangents and socialize instead of remaining focused on the agenda. 
#### The team may seem inefficient to a casual observer. But all the team members
####  speak as much as they need to. They are sensitive to one another’s moods 
#### and share personal stories and emotions. While second team
####  might not contain as many individual stars, the sum will be greater than its parts.

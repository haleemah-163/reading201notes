### Chapter 4: Ch.4 Links Links are created using the <a> element. X The <a> element uses the href attribute to indicate the page you are linking to. X If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs. X You can create links to open email programs with an email address in the "to" field. X You can use the id attribute to target elements within a page that can be linked to.


### Chapter 15: Layout
#### Controlling the Position of Elements
##### CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control the layout of a page: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute positioning. You specify the positioning scheme using the position property in CSS. You can also float elements using the float property

#### Building Blocks
##### CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.
*Block-level boxes start on a new line and act as the main building blocks of any layout, while inline boxes flow between surrounding text. You can control how much space each box takes up by setting the width of the boxes (and sometimes the height, too). To separate boxes, you can use borders, margins, padding, and background colors*

##### Liquid layout designs stretch and contract as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window. They tend to use percentages.
##### Fixed width layout designs do not change size as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window. Measurements tend to be given in pixels
#### so Grids help create professional and flexible designs. CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks. You can include multiple CSS files in one page.

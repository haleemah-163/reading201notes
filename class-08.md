## Duckett HTML book:
### Ch. 15, Layout
##### If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is known as the containing or ##### parent element. To indicate where a box should be positioned, you may also need to use box offset properties to ##### tell the browser how far from the top or bottom and left or right it should be placed. In normal flow, each
##### block-level element sits on top of the next one. Since this is the default way in which browsers treat HTML 
##### elements, you do not need a CSS property to indicate that elements should appear in normal flow, Relative 
##### positioning moves an element in relation to where it would have been in normal flow. is given a value of absolute,  ##### the box is taken out of normal flow and no longer affects the position of other elements on the page.

##### Many web pages use multiple columns in their design. This is achieved by using a <div> element to represent each   ##### column. Different visitors to your site will have different sized screens that show different amounts of  
##### information, so your design needs to be able to work on a range of different sized screens.
##### Because liquid layouts can stretch the entire width of the browser, resulting in long lines of text that are hard  ##### to read, some liquid layouts only let part of the page expand and contract. Other parts of the page have minimum and maximum widths.
##### Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts. And you can include multiple CSS files in one page.

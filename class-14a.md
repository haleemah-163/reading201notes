## What Google Learned From Is Quest to Build The Perfect Team
#### In some places, software engineers are encouraged to work togethor because some
#### studies show that groups tend to innovate faster and see mistakes more 
#### quickly to find better solutions for their problems. those studies also show
#### that the teams tend to acheive better results and higher job satisfication  
#### So The right norms,could raise a group’s collective intelligence,
#### whereas the wrong norms could hobble a team, even if, individually, 
#### all the members were exceptionally bright. 
#### SO the two thimgs which are common between good groups are:
- members spoke in roughly the same proportion 
#### as Woolley said:
> As long as everyone got a chance to talk, the team did well
- the good teams all had high ‘‘average social sensitivity


## CSS Transforms, Transitions and Animations 

#### The translate value works a bit like that of relative positioning, pushing and 
#### pulling an element in different directions without interrupting the
#### normal flow of the document. There are four transition related properties in total, including
#### transition-property, transition-duration, transition-timing-function, and transition-delay.
####  Not all of these are required to build a transition, with the first three are the most popular.
#### One of the hottest button styles right now is the ghost button; a button with no background and a heavy border.
#### We can of course add a border to an element simply, but that will change the element’s position.  
#### We could fix that problem using box sizing, but a far simpler solution is the transition in a border using an inset box shadow.

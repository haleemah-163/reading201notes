### Chapter 6: Tables
##### A table is drawn out row by row. Each row is created with the <tr> element. Inside each row there are a number of cells represented by the <td> element (or <th> if it is a header). For long tables you can split the table into a <thead>, <tbody>, and <tfoot>.

### Chapter 3: Functions, Methods, and Objects
##### Sometimes you will want several objects to represent similar things. Object constructors can use a function as a template for creating objects. First, create the template with the object's properties and methods. In JavaScript, data is represented using name/value pairs. To organize your data, you can use an array or object to group a set of related values. In arrays and objects the name is also known as a key
##### The topmost object in the Document Object Model (or DOM) is the document object. It represents the web page loaded into the current browser window or tab 
##### Whenever you have a value that is a string, you can use the properties and methods of the String object on that value such as :
* toUpperCase () 
* tolowerCase ()
* charAt () 
* indexOf() 
* lastlndexOf()
* substring()
* split()
* trim() 
* replace() 
##### Whenever you have a value that is a number, you can use the methods and properties of the Number object on it. 
##### The Math object has properties and methods for mathematical constants and functions.
##### Once you have created a Date object, the following methods let you set and retrieve the time and date that it represents:
- getDate()
- getDay () 
- getFul 1 Year()
- getHours () 
- getMi 11 i seconds () 
- getMi nutes ()
- getMonth () 
- getSeconds()
- get Ti me() 
##### and so on ...
##### So Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data sets (and both can contain the other).

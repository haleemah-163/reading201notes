## Duckett HTML 
### Chapter 2: Text
#### When you crete a web page, you add tags to provide extra meaning and allow browsers to show users the appropriate structure for the page. There are some text elements that are not intended to affect the structure of your web pages, but they do add extra information to the pages, they are known as semantic markup such as : <strong> , <blockquote>  and <em>

### Chapter 10: Introducing CSS
#### CSS rules usually appear in a separate document, although they may appear within an HTML page. Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties of the element that you want to change, and the values of those properties. For example, the font-family property sets the choice of font, and the value arial specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.
## Duckett JS
### Chapter 2: Basic JavaScript Instructions
#### JavaScript distinguishes between numbers, strings, and true or false values known as Booleans. An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values. Values in an array are accessed as if they are in a numbered list. It is important to know that the numbering of this list starts at zero. So basically A script is made up of a series of statements. Each statement is like a step in a recipe.

### Chapter 4: Decisions and Loops
#### Scripts often need to behave differently depending upon how the user interacts with the web page and/or the browser window itself. To determine which path to take, programmers often rely upon the following three concepts:
* Evaluations
* decisions
* loops

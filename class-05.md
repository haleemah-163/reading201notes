### hapter 5: Images
##### to edit and save images you have to ensure that they are the right size, format, and resolution. Images created for the web should be saved at a resolution of 72 ppi. Photographs are best saved as JPEGs; illustrations or logos that use flat colors are better saved as GIFs.

### Chapter 11: Color
##### If text is reversed out (a light color on a dark background), you can increase the height between lines and the weight of the font to make it easier to read.
##### CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA. CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values, with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA

### Chapter 12: Text
##### When choosing a typeface, it is important to understand that a browser will usually only display it if it's installed on that user's computer.
##### If you design on a Mac, it is important to check what the typefaces look like on a PC because PCs can render type less smoothly. But if you design on a PC, then it should look fine on a Mac.
##### You can specify a list of fonts separated by commas so that, if the user does not have your first choice of typeface installed, the browser can try to use an alternative font from the list.
##### @font-face allows you to use a font, even if it is not installed on the computer of the person browsing, by allowing you to specify a path to a copy of the font, which will be downloaded if it is not on the user's machine. Because this technique allows a version of the font to be downloaded to the user's computer, it is important that the license for the font permits it to be used in this way. You can control the space between lines of text, individual letters, and words. Text can also be aligned to the left, right, center, or justified. It can also be indented. You can use pseudo-classes to change the style of an element when a user hovers over or clicks on text, or when they have visited a link.
